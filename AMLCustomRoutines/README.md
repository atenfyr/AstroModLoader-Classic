# AMLCustomRoutines

This folder contains some examples of custom routines for AstroModIntegrator Classic. These custom routines will be automatically executed on the "Debug_CustomIntegratorTest" build configuration.

Custom routines can be built either within the AstroModLoader.sln solution (as is the case here) or in a separate solution entirely. If building custom routines in a separate solution, download the .dll files from the following directory and include them as dependencies: https://github.com/atenfyr/AstroModLoader-Classic/tree/master/AstroModIntegrator/CustomRoutineDevKit
